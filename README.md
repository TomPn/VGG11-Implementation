# VGG11-Based CNN for MNIST Classification

This project implements a **VGG11-based convolutional neural network (CNN)** for classifying handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset**. The model is trained with **batch normalization, dropout, and data augmentation** to improve generalization and robustness against image transformations.

## Features
- **VGG11-inspired architecture** with 8 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected layers.
- **Batch normalization & dropout** for improved stability and regularization.
- **Data augmentation** using horizontal/vertical flips and noise perturbations.
- **Evaluation under transformations** to test robustness against flipped and noisy images.
- **Training visualization** with accuracy and loss plots over epochs.
